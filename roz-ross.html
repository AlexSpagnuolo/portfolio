    <p>My team and I were paired with Roz Ross. Before meeting our client, we conducted <span><a class="rolelink" href="/files/spagnuolo-alex-rozrossresearchplan.pdf/">research plan</a></span>. This gave us comprehensive knowledge of the executive coaching industry. Before this project, the three of us had no background knowledge of what these type of people do.</p>
    <p>When we finally met, I interviewed, or just had a friendly business conversation, in order to find out more. We then coded and organized all the data we collected. Finding similarities in the data helped us invision solutions for Roz.</p>
    <p>A <span><a class="rolelink" href="/files/spagnuolo-alex-rozrossprojectbrief.pdf/">project brief</a></span> was written, with the purpose to create an understanding between my team and our client to confirm that both sides share the same objectives, scope and expectations. Our brief outlined the following: background, objectives, audience, message, design principles, scope, success criteria, stakeholders, team and schedule.</p>
    <p>With the project brief approved, we were ready to develop the first round of creative.</p>

  <div class="max-length gutter">
    <p>I prepared a <span><a class="rolelink" href="/files/spagnuolo-alex-rozrosspitch.pdf">pitch</a></span> to Roz, where the proposed designs demonstrated a strong relationship to the objectives and principles outlined in the brief. The pitch was designed in a print version as well, on 11x17 foam core boards. The pitch included two main concepts, each with three different logo designs. <span><a class="rolelink" href="/files/spagnuolo-alex-rozrosswireframes.pdf/">Website wireframes</a></span> were included. The business objective, personas, key message, design principles, moodboards, user stories and a sitemap were also in the pitch.</p>
    <p>Revisions were made and a final logo was designed and approved. Now that the logo was established and main production could begin, I created a backlog to keep track and organize all the tasks that needed to be completed.</p>
    <p>After some production, we met again with Roz where prototypes of the website and brand guide were shown.</p>
    <p class="push-0">I conducted <span><a class="rolelink" href="/files/spagnuolo-alex-rozrossusability.pdf">usability testing</a></span> on the website. Five people were asked to complete four main tasks on the website. Once all the tasks were tested, I summarized the friction I identified and came up with ways to overcome the issues in the next iteration.</p>
