      <p>The notes of being able to create a memorable impression through design is what gets me going. Having the skills to design and dance to the beat of different drums is what defines my versatility. Working with multiple mediums is an advantage that I enjoy, to always learn more and keep stimulated.</p>

      <p>My design principles and art philosophies are on other ends of the spectrum. It's almost like having two personalities you switch between in life. Sometimes leaking into each other, sometimes not. Together are a decision-making powerhouse. I believe you can draw muse from anywhere, you just need to use the right lens to find it. Everything is beautiful, all that matters is being able to interpret.</p>
      <p class="push-0">Sometimes you have to get messy. Sometimes you have to get proper and to the point. Balance both. I love connecting the two worlds of art and design.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-2">Logical mind</h3>
      <p>Seeing through shades of cool, I am my only god. Free with the power to create my own life, defy fate and walk my own path. Focused planning, defined personal and professional goals, and a head-on approach.</p>

      <p>Put on heart-shaped sunglasses. Making mistakes and growing from them, going with the flow and keeping an open agenda, is an important part of life as well.</p>

      <p class="max-length">This is where it all started. 3 year old me in playgroup was just going at the paper with a potato masher, thinking that <span class="italic">this is such a masterpiece</span>. Creativity is intelligence having fun. It is ideas clashing. Art can be both a technical skill and an expressive outlet. Through it, I learned to question everything and violate the rules because I know how to observe them.</p>
